"One Heart, One Mind" (also known as "One Heart Drum") is a teamwork ability development project. The props of the program are a double-sided drum of cowhide, with multiple ropes fixed in the middle of the drum body, and the fixed points of the ropes on the drum body are evenly distributed along the circumference, and each rope is of the same length. Each team member pulls a rope to keep the drum surface horizontal. At the beginning of the event, the ball is dropped vertically from the center of the drum, and the team members work together to turn the ball up and make it bounce rhythmically on the drum surface. During the bouncing process, the players can only grasp the end of the rope and cannot touch the drum or any other part of the rope.
Try to develop a mathematical model to solve the following problems.
1. In an ideal situation, each player can precisely control the direction, timing, and force of the force. Discuss the best strategy for teamwork in this situation and give the height of the bounced ball under this strategy.
2. In the real situation, the timing and force of the players cannot be precisely controlled, and there is a certain error, so the drum surface may be tilted. Try to build a model to describe the relationship between the timing and strength of the players and the tilt angle of the drum at a particular moment. Let the number of players is 8, the length of the rope is 1.7m, the initial moment of the drum surface is horizontal and stationary, the initial position is 11 cm lower than when the rope is horizontal, the different timing and strength of the players are given in Table 1, and the tilt angle of the drum surface at 0.1 s is sought.
3. In a realistic situation, according to the model in Problem 2, does the strategy you gave in Problem 1 need to be adjusted? If so, how can it be adjusted?
4. When the drum surface is tilted, the direction of the ball jumping is no longer vertical, so the players need to adjust the rope pulling strategy. Suppose the number of 10, the rope length is 2m, the bounce height of the ball is 60cm, the tilt angle is 1 degree relative to the vertical direction, and the projection of the tilt direction in the horizontal plane points between two players, and the ratio of the angle between these two players is 1:2. In order to adjust the ball to the vertical state bounce, please give the timing and strength of all the players under the precise control conditions, and analyze in real situations The effect of the implementation of this adjustment strategy.

“同心协力”（又称“同心鼓”）是一项团队协作能力拓展项目。该项目的道具是一面牛皮双面鼓，鼓身中间固定多根绳子，绳子在鼓身上的固定点沿圆周呈均匀分布，每根绳子长度相同。团队成员每人牵拉一根绳子，使鼓面保持水平。项目开始时，球从鼓面中心上方竖直落下，队员同心协力将球颠起，使其有节奏地在鼓面上跳动。颠球过程中，队员只能抓握绳子的末端，不能接触鼓或绳子的其他位置。
试建立数学模型解决以下问题：
1. 在理想状态下，每个人都可以精确控制用力方向、时机和力度，试讨论这种情形下团队的最佳协作策略，并给出该策略下的颠球高度。
2. 在现实情形中，队员发力时机和力度不可能做到精确控制，存在一定误差，于是鼓面可能出现倾斜。试建立模型描述队员的发力时机和力度与某一特定时刻的鼓面倾斜角度的关系。设队员人数为8，绳长为1.7m，鼓面初始时刻是水平静止的，初始位置较绳子水平时下降11 cm，表1中给出了队员们的不同发力时机和力度，求0.1 s时鼓面的倾斜角度。
3. 在现实情形中，根据问题2的模型，你们在问题1中给出的策略是否需要调整？如果需要，如何调整？
4. 当鼓面发生倾斜时，球跳动方向不再竖直，于是需要队员调整拉绳策略。假设人数为10，绳长为2m，球的反弹高度为60cm，相对于竖直方向产生1度的倾斜角度，且倾斜方向在水平面的投影指向某两位队员之间，与这两位队员的夹角之比为1:2。为了将球调整为竖直状态弹跳，请给出在可精确控制条件下所有队员的发力时机及力度，并分析在现实情形中这种调整策略的实施效果。

### important
latex is written using VScode with Latex expansion pack, and it fails to encode when opened with other software !!!!!
It's not the problem of tex file !!!!!!!

latex采用VScode搭载Latex拓展包进行书写，用其他软件打开都会编码失败!!!!!
并不是tex文件的问题!!!!!!!
